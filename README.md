# Web RTL-SDR

This is an early prototype of a web-based RTL-SDR tuner.

It heavily relies on Sandeep Mistry's [rtlsdrjs](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/rtlsdrjs) library and Google's 
[Radio Receiver](https://github.com/google/radioreceiver) Chrome app by Jacobo Tarr√≠o. This is just a basic Vue.js UI on top 
of those libraries with some visualisations added.

The code is mostly messy and uncommented, and about the quality you'd expect from a prototype, but there might be some
useful snippets if you're looking to do SDR on the web.

This project has only been tested with the RTL-SDR Blog V3 dongle. Other dongles with the same chipset might work too.
